Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Everything except adding a usable power up, and final beautify-ing of the game. Finished milestones include having the minesweeper board scroll, custom images and sounds, increasing speed over time, difficulty selection, and a high-score keeper. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Have yet to add a power up to the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No major problems yet that have seriously hindered progress, but immense struggling occured with having local zeroes auto-clear when you click on them in the minesweeper board. I think it would require me to redo how I structured the whole minesweeper board creation, which would massively change the rest of the code.
