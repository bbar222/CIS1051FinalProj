# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Timesweeper

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Minesweeper, but the screen keeps moving up over time, so you must clear mines fast enough to keep up.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Timesweeper is a game like minesweeper, except the board is a set width, and an infinite height. The screen will be moving up over time, so your goal is to get as high as you can without any uncleared mines touching the bottom of the screen. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not combining projects

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Don't plan to collaborate

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Minesweeper with the height of the board going up infinitely, and the screen moving up over time.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

(The previous outcome), plus power ups for the player to use, like a time-stop or a 'clear every mine in an area' button.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

(The previous outcome), plus an automatic clearing mode to test the limits of the game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I plan on making this in pygame, so I will need to research and refer back to the documentation for that when displaying visuals and receiving input from the player. 
Will also need to research how to display visuals in a game based on an array, and how to have that array expand infinitely based on where the player is on the map. May also need to remove parts of this array to save memory in case the player gets too high?
